Claude is an algorithm for modeling dynamic systems with a living network. I plan to use elements of neural networks, information theory, cellular automata, and coevolution. It's built on Benoit, a framework I wrote for distributed software networks. I'm writing Claude for my graduate work at UT-Austin.
